I used Chatgpt to plan my steps, to decide which tech stack suits best to complete, to design the APIs, to write the backend logic, to set up the database connection, and to structure the UI.
I also took help while deploying to render, while fixing issues and errors, and to ensure every feature matched the assignment requirements
